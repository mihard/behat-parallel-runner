## Behat parallel runner [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mihard/behat-parallel-runner.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mihard/behat-parallel-runner)

### What is it?

It is a simple launcher of behat tests, which allow:

 - to run each test in a separate process
 - to run several test in parallel

### How to use

- Put the executable file into the root of testable project (on the same level with `vendor` directory)
- Run following command

```
$ bpr -workers 2 -behat ./bin/behat -- -s my_suite
```
where `bpr` is the name of executable file and after `--` can be any regular behat arguments.

The executable binary you can find on the releases page.
